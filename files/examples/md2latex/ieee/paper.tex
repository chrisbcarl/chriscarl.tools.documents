\section{Introduction}\label{Introduction}

If you'd like to make a large section, feel free to type as normal underneath it. You can use double newlines to make a new sentence. Note that I'm using english generated text from \url{https://placeholdertext.org/english-placeholder-text/}.

Clearly who two here society spoon computer tiny wet from me man. Valley mostly cleverly stone sunny farm — long special weak if ten company work bored email daughter; Clear hour... Musician eleven result monument: yellow phone heavy upload measure thirsty nature, fast by already car my. Planet stay clock probably build scroll information forward tower faith lift space fourteen visitor keyboard dead, child peace digital fourteen. Help blanket continent, working monument, mother Sunday office later late screen: green music count old!



\section{Basics}\label{Basics}

Lets go over some basics.



\subsection{Autocorrected}\label{Autocorrected}

Double spaced words are auto-corrected to single space. ``Quotations" are adjusted accordingly, normally you'd need a `\lstinline{'} to get the opening quote, and a \lstinline{''} to get the closing. This is handled already. Apostrophe's are also handled.



\subsection{Typesetting}\label{Typesetting}

If you want \emph{italicized}, use the two asterisks as normal.

If you want \textbf{bolded}, use the four asterisks as normal.

If you want \textbf{\emph{bolded and italicized}}, use the six asterisks as normal.




\subsection{Citations}\label{Citations}

Here's how I do basic citations with a bibliography.

If you want a basic citation, just use \lstinline{<>} and include the \lstinline{BibTex} key \cite{CitekeyArticle}. If you want to add a page number, feel free to do so. \cite[p. 66]{Citekey-Inproceedings}. You can also add a range of page numbers like so: \cite[pp. 69-99]{CitekeyProceedings}. If you want to say section instead of page, use \cite[\S 69-99]{CitekeyBook}. Say you want to include a chapter title in the middle of the citation, go do it \cite[Some Chapter Inside, pp. 66-69]{CitekeyBooklet}.



\subsubsection{Advanced}\label{Advanced}

\paragraph{Figures}\label{Figures}

You need to include packages \lstinline{graphicx} if you want figures.




 \begin{figure}[htbp]
 \centerline{\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{image.jpg}}
 \caption{image.jpg}
 \label{image.jpg}
 \end{figure}
 


 \begin{figure}[htbp]
 \centerline{\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{960px-LambdaPlaques.jpg}}
 \caption{image online via \cite{Aimage}}
 \label{960px-LambdaPlaques.jpg}
 \end{figure}
 

I've got two figures, See Fig. ~\ref{image.jpg} and Fig. ~\ref{960px-LambdaPlaques.jpg}. The first figure used is referenced by local file, the other is url. Both are supported. How they are displayed in the document is all down to typesetting and isn't very controllable.

The way you reference them in the document is 'basename', so make sure to copy paste the file basename in full.

You can also reference other things inside the ``alt" description of the image, as I've done in the second table.




\paragraph{Math}\label{Math}

You need to include packages \lstinline{amsmath,amssymb,amsfonts} if you want math.

Inline math is supported like \(y = Ax + b\) as well as \(\forall x \in X\). Or you can make explicit equations like Eq ~\eqref{eq-rm-ilp} and Eq ~\eqref{eq-profit}.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq-rm-ilp}
\begin{aligned}
&\underset{p(v_i), x_{ij1}, x_{ij2}, y_{ij}}{\max{}} \displaystyle\sum_i^N \displaystyle\sum_i^M y_{ij} \\
\text{s.t. } & p(v_i) > p(v_j) \ge 0, v_i \ge v_j \\
& p(v_i) + p(v_j) \ge p(v_i + v_j), \forall v_i, v_j \\
& x_{ij2} \cdot u_{ij} \le p(v_i) \le x_{ij1} \cdot u_{ij} + x_{ij2} \cdot L, \\
& x_{ij1} + x_{ij2} = 1, \\
& 0 \le x_{ij1}; x_{ij2} \le 1, \\
& y_{ij} \le x_{ij1} \cdot L, \\
& y_{ij} \le p(v_i), \\
& y_{ij} \ge p(v_i)-L \cdot (1 - x_{ij1}) \\
& y_{ij} \ge 0 \\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq-profit}
\begin{aligned}
U(p_s, c) &= R(p_s) - E(c) \\
 &= Mp_s \Psi(p_s) - N\displaystyle\sum_{c_k \in c} c_k \Phi_k(c_k)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Quotes}\label{Quotes}

\begin{quotation}
Break weather bad file goal, use capital but polite suddenly honestly tired into open. Probably highway story laugh up tower around possible dark strongly still alive usually, music mountain classroom really too goal.

Wide short direction probably will \cite{CitekeyTechreport} watch faith information May week here empty fake water hard join house soon private safe!

Citizen politely closed across bad different city like mind surface mountain famous partly. Week earth too nurse available walk market safe, deep team house alive lamp speed pillow bright rarely little north.

By - Lorem Ipsum \cite{CitekeyPhdthesis}
\end{quotation}

\paragraph{Tables}\label{Tables}

You need to include packages \lstinline{tabularx,booktabs} if you want tables. For IEEE, I offer two situations--a single column table like Table ~\ref{tbl-1-col}, but double column tables like Table ~\ref{tbl-2-col} are also supported. Currently any table with \(\text{cols} > 3\) will be set up as a double column table else single column table.

\begin{table}
\caption{Single Column Table \cite{CitekeyPhdthesis}}
\label{tbl-1-col}
\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{l C }
\toprule
Column & Also Column \\
\midrule
1 & a\\
2 & b \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

Tables have a specific referencing mechanism which is entirely custom and not portable. It's simply the best I could do on a shoestring...

\begin{table*}
\caption{Two Column Table \cite{CitekeyUnpublished}}
\label{tbl-2-col}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{l l l l C }
\toprule
Numbers & Alphabet & variables & sum & multiplicat \\
\midrule
1 & a & x & + & *\\
2 & b & y & - & / \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{table*}

\paragraph{Code}\label{Code}

You need to include packages \lstinline{lstlistings} if you want code. In every case, you need to specify the caption, ref, and language. The caption and ref are custom, the language portion is normal.

They can be cited using the code- prefix like Listing ~\ref{code-python}, Listing ~\ref{code-java}, Listing ~\ref{code-cpp}.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption={Listing with Python in it.}, label={code-python}]
def func():
 print('hello world')

# Note how if you have a really really long comment or something that definitely goes over the column limit, it will be re-indented in an attempt to save itself.
func()

\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java, caption={Listing with Java in it.}, label={code-java}]
public class Main {
 public static int main(String[] args) {
 System.out.println("hello world");
 return 0;
 }
}

\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Listing with C++ in it.}, label={code-cpp}]
#include <iostream>
using std::cout;
using std::endl;

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
 cout << "hello world" << endl;
 return 0;
}

\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Interdoc Citations}\label{Interdoc-Citations}

You can reference other sections in your own document. I call these ``href" and the following list is all hyperlinked regardless of output format.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Section ~\ref{Introduction}
\item Section ~\ref{Basics}
\begin{itemize}
\item Section ~\ref{Autocorrected}
\item Section ~\ref{Typesetting}
\item Section ~\ref{Citations}
\begin{itemize}
\item Section ~\ref{Advanced}
\begin{itemize}
\item Section ~\ref{Interdoc-Citations}
\item Section ~\ref{Math}
\item Section ~\ref{Figures}
\item Section ~\ref{Quotes}
\item Section ~\ref{Tables}
\item Section ~\ref{Code}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Section ~\ref{Lorem-Ipsum}
\begin{itemize}
\item Section ~\ref{Lots-of-Lorem}
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}


\section{Lorem Ipsum}\label{Lorem-Ipsum}

If you don't have a lot of text, things like figures and double column tables tend to occupy single pages on their own. Just be aware of this.



\subsection{Lots of Lorem}\label{Lots-of-Lorem}

Break weather bad file goal, use capital but polite suddenly honestly tired into open. Probably highway story laugh up tower around possible dark strongly still alive usually, music mountain classroom really too goal. Wide short direction probably will watch faith information May week here empty fake water hard join house soon private safe!
